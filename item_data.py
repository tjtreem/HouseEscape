        "crowbar": (
            "This is a heavy, rust-streaked crowbar. Flakes of reddish metal crumble away as you lift it. "
            "It's cold to the touch - too cold - and for a moment, it feels like it's resisting your "
            "grip, like it doesn't want to be used again."
        ),

        "rusty_key": (
            "It's a small, twisted key corroded nearly beyond recognition. The rust rubs off on your "
            "finger like dried blood. It smells faintly of mold and iron - and something sour "
            "underneath. Whatever this unlocked once, you get the sense that it shouldn't be "
            "opened again."

        "kitchen_knife": (
            "This is a large kitchen knife. The blade is dull and nicked, with deep brownish-red stains along "
            "the edge. It sits too cleanly on top of a patch of dried fluid on the counter, as if someone "
            "placed it there deliberately - like bait."
        ),

        "front_door_key": (
            "It's an ornate brass key, whih is heavier than it looks. Its ridges are sharp and jagged, almost like "
            "teeth. As you close your hand on it, a faint vibration travels up your arm.\n"
            "This was meant to lock something in...not out."
        ),
